## About Project
'Grocery List App' allows a user to build a list of grocery items for their shopping & clears their plan accordingly. It is a small idea we decided to code for our available & time-limited pair programming coding sessions during our enrolment at [Chingu](https://chingu.io/). It allowed us to practice & improve our pair programming skills & develop new practical experience collaborating & delivering a simple & functional React app with React Hooks.
